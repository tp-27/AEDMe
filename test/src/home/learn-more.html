            <h1>What is an AED?</h1>
            <p>
                AED stands for Automated External Defibrilator. It is a portable medical device that is used to treat sudden
                cardiac arrest (SCA) - a condition in which the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. If someone unexpectedly collapses, 
                is unresponsive and not breathing, that person is likely experiencing cardiac arrest.

                SCA is the 2nd leading cause of death in Canada -superscript(1), with approximately 40,000 Canadians experiencing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year and 
                9/10 arrests result in death. That amounts to one cardiac arrest every 12 minutes -superscript(2). The combined use of CPR and an AED 
                may increase the likelihood of survival by 75% or more -superscript(3). For every one minute delay in defibrilation, the survival rate of a cardiac arrest victim 
                decreases by 7 to 10% -superscript(3). 

                AEDs work by analyzing the person's heart rhythm and delivering an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm along cardiopulmonary 
                resuscitation (CPR) compressions. The AED only delivers a shock if the heart is 
                in a rhythm which can be corrected by defibrilation. 

            <h1>Who can use an AED?</h1>
            <p>
                AEDs are designed to be easy to use and can be used by non-medical professionals such as first responders, police officers, and
                bystanders.

                In Ontario, the use of AEDs by non-medical professionals is governed by the Good Samaritan Act. This act provides legal protection
                to individuals who use an AED in good faith to help someone in cardiac arrest. -superscript(4)
            </p>

        
            <h1>How to use an AED?</h1>
            <p>
                Although there are various AED models, the fundamental way to operate an AED is the same across devices. Here are the general steps
                for using an AED:

                <ol>
                    <li>Turn the power on. Either by opening the lid or pressing the power button. All AEDs give voice prompts. They also diplay clear,
                        simple visual instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Attach AED pads to the person's bare chest. There will be an illustration on the AED pads of where to exactly place the pads. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Press the shock button if the voice prompt tells you to. If no shock is advised, continue doing CPR until emergency medical services
                        arrive.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
