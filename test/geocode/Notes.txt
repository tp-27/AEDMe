- create static data with latitude/longitude values
- bad practice: geocoding all locations each time map is loaded
    - instead: cache geocoded results 
    - instead: preload have a file with lat and long values
 
- want to click/mouse over on a div represent nearest AED location
    - then, the corresponding marker will be focused and grow larger than the other markers
    - recenter map?


- edit file paths - fetch(json file location in file tree)
    - currently putting data in src directory


Debugging:
- remember that some features work async, so if data isn't showing, then make sure it is called in the call back function



Still to do:
- geolocation to get current position
- I want to an object that has marker object, address, distance from curr location
- findLocationInfo
    - maybe have a hash table? marker (key) : locationInfo (value)
    - what about duplicates? 
    - maybe need to assign marker with location info before manipulating 
- way to sort university names in alphabetical order

also NOTE *coordinates read from JSON file (longitude, latitude), google maps marker (latitude, longitude) - see line 

Nearest AED panel:
- Display:
    - distance from curr location
    - address
    - direction
- directions to AED: get mode of transit from user - walk, bike, transit, car


AED Locations (common headers)
Guelph: Location,Building #,College,Street Address
Waterloo: Location, Building
Carleton: Location, Building (manual PDF)
Ottawa: Location, building (manual PDF)
Toronto: Location, building (manual PDF)
Mcmaster: Location, building, building #, responsible department
Manitoba: Location, building (manual PDF)
Brock: Location, building, area (manual PDF)


Challenges:
-switching from mymaps to google maps api
- how to automate parsing data from website/PDFs; handling/manipulating different forms of data 
- reformatting data to request from server - (addresses)


Flow of map.html
- init map 
- find query parameter
- load corresponding json file
- add markers to page 
- events:
    - location toggle 
    - find nearest AEDs
